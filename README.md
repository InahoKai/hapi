## Our purpose
is to develop a suite of tools that will allow people to grow a variety of food in diverse environments. Our primary focus is on building intelligent automation for hydroponics and aquaponics. Imagine systems in your garage, basement or local community center that can churn out strawberries and kale, year-round with minimal expertise, expense and effort. That’s what we’re shooting for.

However, people live in diverse locations and are faced with different resource constraints. For instance, access to clean water could be a challenge in Ghana whereas access to energy could be a challenge in Greenland. So alongside the automation platform, we’re also developing equipment to help people overcome those challenges. The multi-stage water filter and the solar thermal air heater are results of this effort.

## Open Source
HAPI is an open project, meaning anyone and everyone can participate to the best of their ability. While many aspects of the project are highly technical, there are also areas where non-technical expertise is needed. If you would like to see what’s going on currently and what cool stuff we’ll be working on next, visit our project management board.
